                <h4>Early Life</h4>
                <p>Timnit Gebru was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to the United States. She pursued her passion for technology by studying Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. She earned her PhD in computer vision under the mentorship of an AI researcher, Fei-Fei Li, where she focused on computer vision and the ethical implications of artificial intelligence.</p>
				<!-- Information about Gebru's career and impact -->
                <h4>Career & Impact</h4>
                <p>Gebru has been a leading voice in AI ethics, advocating for fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI systems. She was one of the co-leaders of Google's ethical AI team, where she researched racial and gender biases in machine learning models. In 2020, she co-authored a paper analyzing the risks of large-scale AI models, including lack of transparency and their tendency to encode harmful biases. Because this paper was so controversial, she left Google, which furthered the conversation about corporate control over AI research and ethical concerns in the tech industry. After she left Google, Gebru founded the <i> Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR)</i>, which is an independent AI research organization that promotes ethical AI development in technological advancements.</p>
