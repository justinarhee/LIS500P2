            <h3>Intersectionality</h3>
            <p>According to Patricia Hill Collins & Sirma Bilge (2016), intersectionality is defined as "understanding and analysing the complexity in the world, in people, and in human experiences".
                <br><br>
                <u>What does this exactly mean?</u> <br> Intersectionality reflects the idea that an individual's identifiers such as
                race, gender, class, sexuality, and such coexist and intersect to shape their unique experiences and perspective.
                When analysing power, social structures, and inequality, it is crucial to note that the organization of power is not a cause-effect
                result from a singular factor, but rather a complex interplay of multiple factors that influence each other.
                Through the lens of intersectionality, we are better able to understand the complexities of how multiple factors work together to 
                influence power balances and society and our individual human experience.

            <h3>Implicit Bias</h3>
            <p>As a member of society who is influenced by the environment we grew up in, 
                it is inevitable that we hold unintentional biases, otherwise known as implicit bias, within us. 
                These implicit bias often reflect our perception built through our experiences and intersectionality.
                Factors such as how we are raised, education, socio-economic class, social groups we are part of, 
                and other identifiers as mentioned previously all contribute to shaping our perception of the world and thus implicit bias. 
                This bias is not always intentional, and can be something we are not even aware of or believe in.
                However, it is crucial we actively work to recognise our implicit biases and work to address them.
                It may be difficult, especially when you aren't aware of them, but continuously trying to be more of the issue
                and taking assessments like the Harvard Implicit Bias Test is a good step towards addressing your implicit bias.

            <h3>Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</h3>
            <p>Take Harvard's Implicit Bias Tests to learn about what bias you might be holding!
                While the results of this test are not definitive, it is a good start to learning more about how your identity affects
                your perceptions of the world and whether they are something you need to address.
                When taking the test ourselves, one member learned that they prefer the religion they grew up in (Christianity) 
                to another religion (Judaism). Although they believed that they did not have a preference, the test helped them realize that the environment they grew up in
                still influenced them, such as they would feel a preference towards the religion they were more comfortable or familiar with. This is an example of how
                implicit bias can go unnoticed.
                Another member learned that they have a preference for people who are thin compared to fat people. They also believed they did not prefer either body type, but the test helped them realize that their upbringing influenced them unconsciously.
				</p>
				<p>We believe that while the IBT is a good start, the way the creators did it could have been better. In the test, you start by saying being thin, or Christianity is associated with sound, and then being fat, or Judaism is associated with being imperfect. But then, halfway through the quiz, they switch it, so now being fat or Judaism is related to sound and vice versa. This can make it confusing as, due to muscle memory, you can continue to go with the first associations.
