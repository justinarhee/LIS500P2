            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am Isha Puri! I am currently a junior studying Data and Information sciences. Some of my interests 
            are watching tv and movies or spending time outdoors such as going for walks. I took this class because
            the summary sounded interesting.</p>
            <p>Hi, I am Justina! I am currently a sophomore studying Computer and Information sciences with a certificate
            in Data Science. Some of my interests are reading, volleyball, watching movies, and making crafts.
            I took this class because I have a passion in software development and security, and wanted to learn more about 
            the interaction between people/society and technology.</p>
