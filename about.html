                <p>Hi, I am Justina! I am an international student from Pangyo, South Korea and currently a sophomore studying Computer and Information sciences with a certificate
                    in Data Science. I am mainly interested in topics of security and privacy, UI/UX, systems, and software development.
                    Outside of academics, some of my interests are reading, volleyball, watching movies, and making crafts.
                    My favourite books are <i>Six of Crows</i> by Leigh Bardugo, <i>Alone With You in the Ether</i> by Olivia Blake, and
                    <i>The Nightingale</i> by Kristin Hannah. My favourite movies are <i>Inception</i>, <i>Everything Everywhere All At Once</i>,
                    and <i>Shrek 2</i>.
                    I took this class because I wanted to learn more about the interaction between people/society and technology.
                    As someone interested in UI/UX design, software development, and security, I thought it was crucial to know more about
                    the key topics of this class to make sure that my contributions and selective choices on the design of my projects
                    reflect my awareness on diversity, equity, and power. </p>

				<!-- Isha Puri's bio -->
                <p>Hi, I am Isha Puri! I am from Santa Clara, California, and I am currently a junior studying data and information sciences. I am interested in data engineering or computer and human interaction. Outside of academics, I am interested in spending time outdoors, such as going for walks or hiking, going to the beach, and watching TV or movies. I am currently rewatching <i> 911 </i>, a police and fire firefighter. I also really enjoy watching comedy movies. I believe the less the movie makes sense the better it is. I took this class because it sounded interesting due to my interest in computer and human interactions. It is essential to understand how what I do in the future will unconsciously affect the users and others.</p>
